# A-Level Computer Science programming project

As part of my OCR Computer Science A-Level, I created a tower defence style game
for my programming project. This was created independently over the span of a year,
and followed an agile development strategy. 

The game was coded using the language Lua, within the game engine Defold. 

This project and its documentation achieved 68/70 marks - a strong A*.
